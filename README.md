# NoteApp

This is a simple Node.JS app that uses the commands "add", "list", "remove", and "read" to update notes that you can personally create.
The app creates JSON objects so they can be easily read and manipulated.
The commands are written in the command line.
Use the app.js file to run the application.

Just messing around - learning the intricasies of NodeJS.
